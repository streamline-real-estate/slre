<p>Early in his real estate career, Jeff Weissman invested heavily in online lead services; it paid off.

Jeff’s excellent follow-up practices help him keep his ROI from online leads sky high, but there’s something else that puts him ahead of the game: it’s the fact that most leads are sold on Jeff’s services before their first conversation.

<p>At first, Beth Traverso didn’t really treat her real estate business like a business. Still, she managed to do fairly well just by winging it. When the 2008 financial crisis hit, however, things changed. Suddenly, Beth and her husband had very little income and three young kids to support. During that difficult time, Beth decided to take action. She took the first step toward building the highly successful real estate group she runs today – a business that generates over $800,000 in profit annually.

On today’s show, we discuss the latest in the case: news of the DOJ demanding CoreLogic’s MLS data. Clearly, this is a sign that federal authorities are investigating claimants’ antitrust allegations. But is it a clear sign that the law firms representing these claimants stand to win?
